# ASE-1819-Cycling-Group1

Project overview:
An app that allows commuters to track their cycling journeys.
The app will calculate the emissions the user has saved by cycling instead of driving over the distance travelled.
The app allows user to view their past journeys as well


To run this app, you will need to create your own google maps API key for the maps to work
and put it into the google_maps_api.xml file in the google_maps_key string.

If you want to recieve the data of the users ride, you will need to add the address of your server
(that is capable of recieving post requests) in the hostname string in both of the strings.xml file
